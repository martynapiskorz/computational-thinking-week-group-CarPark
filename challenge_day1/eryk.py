Anyway, I took a bus to my hotel which was so crowded that I was squeezed against the door the whole time. I arrived at the hotel in the late evening, not aware that I am yet to meet {c1},{c3},{c4}, and {c5}. After making myself comfortable and unpacking in my room I decided to head for the pool.")

The whole situation had me seething. {c2}, calm down. I decided to spend the evening watching Netflix, trying to calm my nerves, but curiosity got the best of me. I wondered what kind of mess {c1}, {c4}, and {c5} were stirring up downstairs.")

He admitted that he had been wrong to take my swimsuit and admitted that a bet with {c5} had spiraled out of control, leading to a chaotic situation involving {c1}, {c2}, {c3}, {c4}, and {c5}. We both laughed at the absurdity of it all and decided to let go of the past. {c4} even offered to prepare a special cocktail as a peace offering.")
