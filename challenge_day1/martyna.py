    print("I always wanted to go to Brazil… This year my dream finally came true. I bought a plane ticket and packed my suitcase which was so huge and heavy that I could barely lift it. The flight was 7 hours but I slept for the most of it. Finally, I landed. When I got off the plane, hot and humid air hit me and it was hard to breathe. But the view in front of me made up for it. I thought to myself, “Okay Eleonora, maybe you suffocate here but at least you’ll be surrounded by beautiful nature”. Anyway, I took a bus to my hotel which was so crowded that I was squeezed against the door the whole time. I arrived at the hotel in the late evening.")
