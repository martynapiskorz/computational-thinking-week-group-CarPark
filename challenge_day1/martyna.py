But this is how it all started: I always wanted to go to Brazilâ€¦ This year my dream finally came true. I bought a plane ticket and packed my suitcase which was so huge and heavy that I could barely lift it. The flight was 7 hours but I slept for the most of it. Finally, I landed. When I got off the plane, hot and humid air hit me and it was hard to breathe. But the view in front of me made up for it.")

While I was going through the corrdidors, I saw this dog, {c3}, and I heard that bartender {c4}'s voice. I saw him tallking to a young boy (he called him {c5}) and {c1} and then... I couldn't believe my eyes!!! There it was! My swimsuit sticking out of his back pocket.")

I realized that sometimes misunderstandings can pave the way for unexpected friendships, and I felt grateful for the adventure that had drawn me closer to {c1}, {c3}, and even {c5}.")
