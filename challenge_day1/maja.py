    print(f"I decided to head to the beach. As it quickly turned out, I forgot the only thing I could possibly need - a swimsuit. '{c2}, you dumb bitch' - I thought. It was missing from the suitcase. What if someone stole it? Could it be the housekeeper? Maybe {c3} or {c4}? It didn't matter. The only thing I cared about was the swimsuit - a beautiful, purple bikini. I decided to confront the front office assistant. A short conversation with {c1}, a middle-aged man with a receding hairline, confirmed my suspicions - someone entered my room after I checked in. {c1} tried to convince me that there was no chance of his staff removing a guest belonging from a room, so talking to him did not make any sense. He had an urgent phone call from someone named {c5}, so I left. I just needed my bikini back.")

    print(f"Meanwhile, back at the hotel, {c1} was making amends for the previous day's debacle. He proposed taking me ({c2}) out for lunch to apologize for his mishandling of the situation. I hesitated but eventually agreed. As we sat at a beachside cafe, {c1} explained that he had received an urgent call from {c5}, which had distracted him from assisting me properly. I couldn't help but wonder if {c4} and {c3} were harboring any grudges.")

    print(f"One night, gathered around a campfire in the heart of the Amazon, I shared my personal ({c2}'s) diary with the group, reciting the entries about my initial days in Brazil and my first impressions of {c1}, {c3}, {c4}, and {c5}. We guffawed at the absurdity of the situation and teased {c4} about his botched thieving attempt, involving all of us in the laughter. {c1} and {c3} divulged their own embarrassing tales, and {c5} couldn't help but chortle at the chaos he had unwittingly incited.")
