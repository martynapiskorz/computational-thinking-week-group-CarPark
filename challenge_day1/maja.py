    print(f"{c1}{c2}{c3}{c4}{c5}I decided to head to the beach. As it quickly turned out, I forgot the only thing I could possibly need - a swimsuit.  It was missing from the suitcase. What if someone stole it? Could it be the housekeeper? It didn't matter. The only thing I cared about was the swimsuit - a beautiful, purple bikini. I decided to confront the front office assistant. A short conversation with Mauricio, a middle-aged man with a receding hairline, confirmed my suspicions - someone entered my room after I checked in. Mauricio tried to convince me that there was no chance of his staff removing a guest belonging from a room, so talking to him did not make any sense. I just needed my bikini back.")
