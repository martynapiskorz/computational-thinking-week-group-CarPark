    print(f"It was so hot and I couldn’t imagine spending this evening without jumping into the water. I ({c2}) was walking around the pool, looking for a sunbed, when I passed the bar and saw a bery symphatetic smile, he introduced himself as {c4}. He was the hotel’s bartender. He looked visibly hangover and explained that he was celebrating birthday yesterday. I asked him whose birthday he celebrated. The young man excitedly told me about his chiuahua named {c3} and briefly mentioned his friends, {c1} and {c5}. I though his story was very boring, but the man was so cute, that I wanted to meet his dog as well. Turns out, it was an annoying and mean dog, so I left to never see {c4} or his dog ever again.")

Unexpectedly, I crossed paths with {c3}, who was taking {c1}'s Chihuahua, {c5}, for a walk. We exchanged awkward greetings, and I couldn't help but wonder if {c4} was still nursing his bruised cheek from the previous night. {c3} assured me that he had no involvement in the swimsuit incident. I remained skeptical but chose to give him the benefit of the doubt.")

We decided to embark on an audacious journey into the heart of the Amazon rainforest, facing thrills and perils that tested the bonds between {c1}, {c2}, {c3}, {c4}, and {c5}. Our dependence on each other to navigate the dense jungle deepened our friendships.")
